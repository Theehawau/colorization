# Colorization Pretraining

This project focuses on pretraining a model for image colorization. The goal is to convert grayscale images into colored images using deep learning techniques.

## Pretraining

The pretraining process involves training a neural network on a large dataset of grayscale and colored image pairs. The model learns to predict the color information from the grayscale input.

### Steps to Pretrain the Model

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure you have a dataset of grayscale and corresponding colored images.
2. **Configure the Model**: Set up the neural network architecture and training parameters.
3. **Train the Model**: Run the training process on the dataset.
4. **Save the Model**: Save the trained model for later use.

## Running the Model

To run the pretrained model and colorize grayscale images, follow these steps:

1. **Load the Model**: Load the pretrained model from the saved file.
2. **Input Grayscale Image**: Provide a grayscale image to the model.
3. **Generate Colored Image**: The model will output the colorized version of the input image.
4. **Save/Display the Result**: Save or display the colorized image.
